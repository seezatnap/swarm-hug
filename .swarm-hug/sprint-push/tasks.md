# Tasks

## Git Command Layer

- [ ] (#1) Add `push_branch_to_remote()` in `src/git.rs` that executes `git push origin <target_branch>` via `std::process::Command` (without `--force`), captures exit status/stdout/stderr, and returns structured success/failure data usable by runner logic and tests [5 pts]
- [ ] (#2) Add `get_commit_log_between()` in `src/git.rs` that executes `git log --oneline <source_branch>..<target_branch>` and returns the output as a string for use in PR description generation [3 pts]
- [ ] (#3) Add `create_pull_request()` in `src/git.rs` that executes `gh pr create --title <title> --body <body> --base <source_branch> --head <target_branch>` via `std::process::Command`, captures stdout (the PR URL) and stderr, and returns structured success/failure data; before running, check that `gh` is on PATH (e.g. via `which gh`) and return early with a skip result if not found [5 pts]

## Sprint Runner Flow

- [ ] (#4) Update `src/runner.rs` after the `merged_ok` block to call push only when `config.target_branch` is explicitly `Some(...)`, the merge was not skipped (`sprint_branch != target_branch`), and shutdown was not requested; preserve current behavior when these conditions are not met [5 pts] (blocked by #1)
- [ ] (#5) Implement push outcome handling in `src/runner.rs`: on success print and record a push status message in merge logger/chat; on failure print a warning, log failure details for debugging, and continue returning sprint success because local merge already succeeded [5 pts] (blocked by #4)
- [ ] (#6) After a successful push in `src/runner.rs`, invoke the current sprint engine with a prompt containing the `get_commit_log_between()` output and asking it to return a JSON object with `"title"` and `"body"` keys for a pull request; parse the JSON from the engine output, falling back to default title `"[swarm] <target_branch>"` and body `"Auto-generated by swarm sprint."` if parsing fails [8 pts] (blocked by #2, #5)
- [ ] (#7) After obtaining PR title and body from the engine, call `create_pull_request()` with the parsed title, body, source branch, and target branch; on success print and log the PR URL; on failure (including `gh` not found) print a warning and continue without failing the sprint [5 pts] (blocked by #3, #6)

## Testing

- [ ] (#8) Add unit tests validating push invocation/skipping based on applicability rules: explicit `--target-branch` provided vs auto-detected default, merge-skipped path (`sprint_branch == target_branch`), and shutdown-requested path [5 pts] (blocked by #4)
- [ ] (#9) Add unit test coverage proving push failure is non-fatal to `run_sprint` (success still returned after local merge) and that warning/debug logging paths are exercised [5 pts] (blocked by #5)
- [ ] (#10) Add unit tests for `create_pull_request()`: verify the `gh pr create` command is formed with correct `--title`, `--body`, `--base`, `--head` flags; verify skip behavior when `gh` is not on PATH; verify failure is non-fatal [5 pts] (blocked by #3)
- [ ] (#11) Add an integration-style test verifying the full post-merge flow: push command is formed correctly, engine is invoked for PR generation, and `gh pr create` is called with the engine-derived title/body (or defaults on parse failure) [8 pts] (blocked by #6, #7)
