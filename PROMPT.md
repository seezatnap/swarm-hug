Look at SPECS.md, make an exhaustive TASKS.md. Then (or if it's already there) take the most important task and do it.

Use ../ralph-bash-v2 as a reference but note that that's the older, fragile project and you should just use it as a reference.

After each turn make sure the README.md is updated and accurate, accessible, and friendly.

Do up to 3 related tasks at once.

If you encounter files larger than 1000 LOC, make tasks to break them apart.

Assure that tests are run after every iteration, and that we fix any issues.





DON'T FORGET TO CHECK IN YOUR WORK
